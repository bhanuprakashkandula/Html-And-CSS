<h3>With Rohit and Shikhar opening the innings, what more could have India asked for. In Virat Kohli, India have the best #3 batsman in the world. While India have had been struggling to find a #4 for their team, KL Rahul seems to fill the position beautifully. Kedar Jadhav although currently injured can be an equally good at that position. Although Vijay Shankar hasn't been able to impress as of late, he too can bat at #4. Dhoni and his experience can come in very handy for India at #5. At #6, we will have Dinesh Karthik followed by Hardik Pandya at #7 playing the role of finisher. Keeping in mind, Pandya's hard-hitting form, we can also anticipate a promotion of Hardik Pandya to #5 and a shift of the rest of the batting order in certain situations. Ravindra Jadeja will probably be our #8. Two of the three pacers will be playing as #9 and #10. And the last man is going to be one of the two spinners.</h3>
